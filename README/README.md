## Background
Accessibility focuses on how a disabled person accesses or benefits from a site, system or application. Accessibility is an important part of the designing your site and should be considered throughout the development process. Section 508 is the governing principle and it requires that all government information be accessible to disabled users. (https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/accessibility.html)

## Goals
The goal of this project is to refactor the exisitng code for Horiseon:copyright: to ensure accessibility, as well as organize, edit, and clean up HTML and CSS files. Using semantic tags and alt text for images, the goal of increased accessibility has been acheived. All duplicate code was removed and each line was reorganized.
